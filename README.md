# ResilientCommand
A Resiliency library for wrapping dependency calls. Heavily inspired by Hystrix

The idea is simple; protect against up/down- stream problems, by encapsulating calls to these dependencies in reliability patterns.
This project seeks to do just that. 

There is a getting started Guide [here](https://github.com/VisualBean/ResilientCommand/wiki/Getting-Started).   
Please check the [wiki](https://github.com/VisualBean/ResilientCommand/wiki) for more information
or the [examples](https://github.com/VisualBean/ResilientCommand/tree/main/ResilientCommand.Examples) some usage examples.
